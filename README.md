# 88-718 Python Tutorial

## Instructions

1. Read [Python Self-Assessment and Worksheet](https://static.kentkchang.com/pdf/LSSP_Python.pdf).
2. Ask Kent for an account on [https://jupyter.kentkchang.com](https://jupyter.kentkchang.com).
3. After you have logged in, visit this [link](https://jupyter.kentkchang.com/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fkentchang%2Flssp-lab&branch=master&app=lab) to start your own Jupyter Lab instance.

## Outline

* **Premises**:
    - You don't learn the syntax of Python (or any language, for that matter); you get used to it because you need to.
    - You don't need to learn everything about Python to do anything.
    - You want to do well on your final project, not necessarily become a Python programmer.
* Part 1: Python basics
* Part 2: Applications
    - (a) Topic modeling with MALLET
    - (b) Vector semantics 

## After class

1. Install the necessary packages (you can do this in an `virtualenv`):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. You can download the notebooks onto your machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/kentchang/lssp-lab.git
```

3. Set up mallet: see [this](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/download.php).
